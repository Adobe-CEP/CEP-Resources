Archived versions CEP 4.x to CEP 7.x
==============

This page provides the resources you need to get started in order to create extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, using the new HTML5/JavaScript interface model. The Flash/ActionScript interface model for extensions is deprecated in Creative Cloud releases; Support has already been removed from CC2014 and later releases.

* In the Creative Cloud 2015.x release in June 2016, Photoshop and Illustrator use CEP 7 while other applications still use CEP 6.1. Extensions and add-ons must be built on at least CEP 6 infrastructure.

* In the Creative Cloud 2015 release, extensions and add-ons must be built on the CEP 6 infrastructure.

* In the Creative Cloud 2014 release, extensions and add-ons must be built on the CEP 5 infrastructure and loaded with Extension Manager. The current releases either do not now or soon will not support CEP 4 and Flash/ActionScript extensions.

* The Creative Suite 6 and the Creative Cloud 2013 releases of Adobe desktop applications support CEP 4, which allows you to build extensions using the older Flash/ActionScript interface model. However, the new HTML5/JavaScript model is preferred. It is recommended that you port existing Flash/ActionScript extensions to the new model.

This SDK provides the low-level tools that you need to build extensions. Extensions that you build using these tools must be packaged as ZXP files in order to be seen and loaded by Extension Manager. You can offer extensions as free or paid products through our marketing portals (Adobe Exchange, the Add-ins website, the Creative Cloud desktop app). When you do this, you upload the extension to Adobe as a single ZXP file.

Resources you will need include:
* CEP JavaScript libraries for communicating with the operating system and Extension Manager and for communicating with the host application and other extensions.
* Sample code for how to use these libraries
* The ZXP packager, a command-line utility
