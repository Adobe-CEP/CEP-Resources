Getting Started with Common Extensibility Platform (CEP)
==============

This page provides the resources you need to [get started](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides) in order to create extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, using the new HTML5/JavaScript interface model. The Flash/ActionScript interface model for extensions is deprecated in Creative Cloud releases; Support has already been removed from CC2014 and later releases.

* CEP 11 is available for developing extensions and add-ons in latest versions of Creative Cloud Applications. Refer to the [table](./CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#applications-integrated-with-cep) for Creative Cloud products integration with CEP 11.

* CEP 10 is available for developing extensions and add-ons in latest versions of Creative Cloud Applications. Refer to the [table](./CEP_10.x/Documentation/CEP%2010.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#applications-integrated-with-cep) for Creative Cloud products integration with CEP 10.

* Creative Cloud 2019 products include CEP 9 for developing extensions and add-ons. Refer to the [table](./CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP%209.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#applications-integrated-with-cep) for 2019 products integration with CEP 9.


This SDK provides the low-level tools that you need to build extensions. Extensions that you build using these tools must be packaged as ZXP files in order to be seen and loaded by Extension Manager. You can offer extensions as free or paid products through our marketing portals (Adobe Exchange, the Add-ins website, the Creative Cloud desktop app). When you do this, you upload the extension to Adobe as a single ZXP file.

Resources you will need include:
* CEP JavaScript libraries for communicating with the operating system and Extension Manager and for communicating with the host application and other extensions.
* Sample code for how to use these libraries
* The ZXP packager, a command-line utility
