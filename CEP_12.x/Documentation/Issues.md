CEP 12 Known Issues & FAQ
====================

### Following are the known issues in CEP. Please keep these in mind while creating your own extensions 

## Issue 1 (CEP 12) : CSInterface's version specific APIs show incorrect Operating System Version
CSInterfaces API are unable to detect OS version correctly (Win 11, Mac OS 12(only arm) and Mac OS 13 (both intel and arm)) because of underlying CEF limitations. CEP 12 will not be able to list the correct OS version details those platforms.

### Note:
This does not impact Win 10 and Mac OS's less than v11

  
## Issue 2 (CEP 12): SharedArrayBuffer changes can't be accessed if Cross-Origin isolation is disabled
Extensions can go blank if it uses SharedArrayBuffer with Cross-Origin isolation disabled. This issue was introduced in CEF 91 and it is carried into CEF 99 as well.
